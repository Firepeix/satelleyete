#Satelleyete
##Summary
Satelleyete is a web-app that helps people to engage with the reality of our near space. An easy to browse app, Satelleyete shows the current artificial satellites in our orbit, basic characteristics and it's position relative to Earth, using NASA's information database.
How We Addressed This Challenge
This project hopes to bridge the gap between specialists and people that don't already know the technical terminology. So anyone can access satellite information without knowing how to parse complex, domain-specific data.

##How We Developed This Project
What inspired us was the amount of satellites in orbit of our planet, we had no ideia tha so many existed. It really put a perspective 2 things, tha amount of data that can be extracted and the amount of space garbage tha we have around us. We used Figma for protipation and Miro for brainstorming. As a team with plenty experience with VueJs Framework and Laravel Framework, and that NASA WorldWind could integrate well within the vue ecosystem. For the database we chose MongoDB because the amount of relationships was minimal and we need little overhead for fast prototipatyon

##How We Used Space Agency Data in This Project
For the backend we used NASA' s SSC RESTful API for getting satellites in orbit as well the location where they are and for the visualization of space and the satellites we used the WorldWind project.
